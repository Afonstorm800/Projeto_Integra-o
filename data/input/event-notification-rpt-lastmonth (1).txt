The licensee reported that a Y-90 microsphere procedure resulted in 71 percent of the prescribed dose being administered to a patient (a difference of 29 percent), and that a spill also occurred during the administration. The licensee is reporting that the spill originated from the delivery system and likely caused the medical event.

"According to the report, the radiation monitor used to perform required radioactivity measurements of the pool water (e.g., leak testing of the pool irradiator sources) failed at some point in the last month. It was discovered yesterday, 7/16/25, during a routine monthly check when the system failed to alarm when tested with a check source.    "Replacement monitoring equipment was installed, and the pool water was determined to be free of radioactivity. This incident had no impact to public or worker safety, nor is there any indication of leaking sources. However, the reportable criteria in 32 Illinois Administrative Code 340.122(c)(2) appear to have been met. The licensee met the 24-hour reporting requirement, and the Agency will report the matter to the NRC shortly.    "Inspectors will conduct a reactive inspection to determine root cause and corrective action."

Additionally, the corporate radiation safety officer reviewed additional tests conducted on 7/16/25 (surveys of the deionization tanks conducted and pool water sample collected and analyzed for radioactive contamination) to confirm no leaking of sources, all with negative results.    "On 8/20/25, inspectors followed up during a routine inspection and confirmed that replacement monitoring equipment had been installed and was calibrated and functional. The licensee advised that they were still waiting on a report from the manufacturer to determine if any additional corrective measures would be instituted. The licensee stated that any information received would be shared with the Agency. Regardless, the Agency will follow up at the time of next inspection."

The limit switches were dedicated by CW and shipped on 2/28/2025 to Xcel Energy. The switches failed a bench test performed by Xcel Energy, which aimed to verify that the contacts properly revert to their original state during spring return. Xcel Energy found that the contacts reverted to their original state prior to the audible click/snap, which is supposed to indicate contact changeover.    The two units were returned to Curtiss-Wright on 5/29/2025. The test result was fully duplicated on one of the switches. For the other switch (serial number 04), the switch contacts intermittently failed to return to the original state at all, requiring manual assistance to do so.    On 6/26/2025, CW sent the parts to NAMCO for repair. CW retested the parts after the repair. Part 04 still had the same issue with failing to reset as noted earlier. That limit switch was returned to NAMCO for a full evaluation.     CW anticipates an update to this notification with final results on 9/23/2025.    Potentially affected U.S. nuclear power plants:  unknown at the time of the notification.

CW retested the limit switches and one failed for the same issue as noted earlier, the failed limit switch was returned to NAMCO for a full evaluation.  The failure is still under investigation and CW has been in communication with NAMCO, the manufacturer.    Once the evaluation is complete this report will be updated.

This event occurred on SR 16 eastbound directly before the Tacoma Narrows Bridge in Gig Harbor, Washington. The nuclear gauge that was damaged was a licensed Troxler model 3450. The damage appeared to consist of the handle being separated from the body of the gauge. The gauge was not in use at the time.    "The radiation safety officer (RSO) cordoned off the area and prevented individuals from coming within 150 feet of the source. The timeline of this event is still being investigated. The RSO contacted WADOH at 0205 PDT. Emergency response, consisting of fire and hazmat personnel, arrived on site at approximately 0500 equipped with a Geiger Mueller radiation detection instrument. Two individuals donned Tyvek [suits] and proceeded towards the source, with WADOH directing their response via telephone communication. The highest radiation levels were 15 mR/hr, measured approximately one foot from the source, which indicated that the sources were likely still within the shielded position. The two emergency responders used a shovel to pick the source handle and gauge body up and place the pieces back into the Troxler type 'A' shipping container. This took approximately 8 minutes and the dose received is assumed to be less than 2 mrem each. The container was then closed, and additional radiation surveys were taken. The on contact dose on the exterior of the container was 2 mR/hr, which is below the expected dose rate while within the container. WADOH arrived on-site at approximately 0730 PDT and took contamination surveys on the source assembly, which was visibly intact. No contamination was detected.     "Under Troxler's guidance, the licensee transported the material within the type 'A' container back to their calibration facility to perform leak tests. Leak tests have been performed and are being sent out for counting prior to shipment back to Troxler. The gauge will remain in a secured position until it is shipped back to Troxler. The licensee will follow Troxler guidance and all applicable DOT regulations. A full report will be delivered to WADOH within 30 days. WADOH will continue conversations with the licensee to determine the full scope of the situation, and additional details will be provided as they are found."    Gauge sources: 9 mCi Cs-137, 44 mCi Am-241/Be, and 66 microcuries Cf-252    WA Incident Number: WA 25-009      * * * UPDATE ON 09/10/2025 AT 1759 EDT FROM DANE BLAKINGER TO JOSUE RAMIREZ * * *    The following information was provided by the Washington State Department of Health, Office of Radiation Protection (WADOH) via email:    "Dose assessment: Four responders were on-site. Two responders were in a radiation field of up to 15 mR/hr for 8 minutes. The conservative estimate is a 2 mrem total effective dose equivalent each. Dose to WADOH responder was less than 1 mrem.  "[As part of corrective actions,] WADOH has generated job aids for responding to portable gauge emergencies. Additional procedural changes are being developed. Focused training on similar emergencies is being developed to ensure office-wide readiness.  "The licensee will internally audit all emergency procedures for portable gauge license, including updating the gauge transportation forms with radiation safety officer personal phone number. All required traffic control was in place.  "No further actions required. Corrective actions will be verified during a routine inspection."
