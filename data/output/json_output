The limit switches were dedicated by CW and shipped on 2/28/2025 to Xcel Energy. The switches failed a bench test performed by Xcel Energy, which aimed to verify that the contacts properly revert to their original state during spring return. Xcel Energy found that the contacts reverted to their original state prior to the audible click/snap, which is supposed to indicate contact changeover.    The two units were returned to Curtiss-Wright on 5/29/2025. The test result was fully duplicated on one of the switches. For the other switch (serial number 04), the switch contacts intermittently failed to return to the original state at all, requiring manual assistance to do so.    On 6/26/2025, CW sent the parts to NAMCO for repair. CW retested the parts after the repair. Part 04 still had the same issue with failing to reset as noted earlier. That limit switch was returned to NAMCO for a full evaluation.     CW anticipates an update to this notification with final results on 9/23/2025.

This event occurred on SR 16 eastbound directly before the Tacoma Narrows Bridge in Gig Harbor, Washington. The nuclear gauge that was damaged was a licensed Troxler model 3450. The damage appeared to consist of the handle being separated from the body of the gauge. The gauge was not in use at the time.    \"The radiation safety officer (RSO) cordoned off the area and prevented individuals from coming within 150 feet of the source. The timeline of this event is still being investigated. The RSO contacted WADOH at 0205 PDT. Emergency response, consisting of fire and hazmat personnel, arrived on site at approximately 0500 equipped with a Geiger Mueller radiation detection instrument. Two individuals donned Tyvek [suits] and proceeded towards the source, with WADOH directing their response via telephone communication. The highest radiation levels were 15 mR/hr, measured approximately one foot from the source, which indicated that the sources were likely still within the shielded position. The two emergency responders used a shovel to pick the source handle and gauge body up and place the pieces back into the Troxler type 'A' shipping container. This took approximately 8 minutes and the dose received is assumed to be less than 2 mrem each. The container was then closed, and additional radiation surveys were taken. The on contact dose on the exterior of the container was 2 mR/hr, which is below the expected dose rate while within the container. WADOH arrived on-site at approximately 0730 PDT and took contamination surveys on the source assembly, which was visibly intact. No contamination was detected.     \"Under Troxler's guidance, the licensee transported the material within the type 'A' container back to their calibration facility to perform leak tests. Leak tests have been performed and are being sent out for counting prior to shipment back to Troxler. The gauge will remain in a secured position until it is shipped back to Troxler. The licensee will follow Troxler guidance and all applicable DOT regulations. A full report will be delivered to WADOH within 30 days. WADOH will continue conversations with the licensee to determine the full scope of the situation, and additional details will be provided as they are found.\"    Gauge sources: 9 mCi Cs-137, 44 mCi Am-241/Be, and 66 microcuries Cf-252    WA Incident Number: WA 25-009      * * * UPDATE ON 09/10/2025 AT 1759 EDT FROM DANE BLAKINGER TO JOSUE RAMIREZ * * *    The following information was provided by the Washington State Department of Health, Office of Radiation Protection (WADOH) via email:    \"Dose assessment: Four responders were on-site. Two responders were in a radiation field of up to 15 mR/hr for 8 minutes. The conservative estimate is a 2 mrem total effective dose equivalent each. Dose to WADOH responder was less than 1 mrem.  \"[As part of corrective actions,] WADOH has generated job aids for responding to portable gauge emergencies. Additional procedural changes are being developed. Focused training on similar emergencies is being developed to ensure office-wide readiness.  \"The licensee will internally audit all emergency procedures for portable gauge license, including updating the gauge transportation forms with radiation safety officer personal phone number. All required traffic control was in place.  \"No further actions required. Corrective actions will be verified during a routine inspection.\"    Notified R4DO (Deese) and NMSS Event Notification (email)",

The gauge was stored in the bed of a pickup truck that had a canopy cover. The gauge was also chained to the bed of the truck. The vehicle was parked inside of a parking garage with camera surveillance. Unfortunately, the cameras were [decoys] and were not operating.    \"An individual gained access to the gauge by breaking through a canopy window and using a bolt cutter to cut the chain securing the Troxler gauge. The density gauge was the only nuclear material stolen. A toolbox was also taken which contained various non-nuclear equipment.     \"The employee contacted Seattle Police, who at 1401 [PDT], had not arrived on scene to generate a report. The licensee will ensure that a report is generated and work with local law enforcement to recover the gauge. A full report will follow within 30 days.\"    Device Information:  Manufacturer: Troxler  Model: CDCW556  Serial Number: 14086    Source Information:  Manufacturer: AEA Technology/QSA  Model: CDCW556 (Cs-137) and AMNV.997 (Am-241:Be)  Isotopes and Activity: 9 mCi of Cs-137, 44 mCi of Am-241:Be, 0.066 mCi of Cf-252        * * * UPDATE ON 09/29/2025 AT 1747 EDT FROM DANE BLAKINGER TO JOSUE RAMIREZ * * *    The Washington State Department of Health, Office of Radiation Protection provided a 30-day written report regarding the incident (WA-25-010).  The gauge has not been located at this time. The licensee has an open case with the Seattle Police Department. In addition, the gauge is being actively looked for by the licensee.    Notified R4DO (Vossmar), NMSS Event Notification (email), ILTAB (email), and CNSC (email).        THIS MATERIAL EVENT CONTAINS A 'Less than Cat 3' LEVEL OF RADIOACTIVE MATERIAL    Sources that are \"Less than IAEA Category 3 sources,\" are either sources that are very unlikely to cause permanent injury to individuals or contain a very small amount of radioactive material that would not cause any permanent injury. Some of these sources, such as moisture density gauges or thickness gauges that are Category 4, the amount of unshielded radioactive material, if not safely managed or securely protected, could possibly - although it is unlikely - temporarily injure someone who handled it or were otherwise in contact with it, or who were close to it for a period of many weeks.

The incident occurred at the University of Louisiana at Lafayette New Iberia Research Center at approximately 1515 CDT. The RSO reported that during a direct transmission density measurement, in which the source was submerged in approximately eight inches of soil, the gauge was run over by the bulldozer. The gauge source rod was tilted in the soil approximately 45 degrees from the normal. It could not be determined if the source rod was bent, and no attempt was made to retract the density source into the safe position. The gauge possessed two sealed sources, an 8 mCi Cs-137 source, S/N 750-2469, and a 40 mCi Am/Be-241 source, S/N 47-25460. Both sources are approximately 28 years old. The gauge operator is currently maintaining an exclusion area of approximately 30 feet in radius about the gauge, which had a housing that was partially broken apart during the rollover. No radiation surveys have yet been performed of the gauge or surrounding area. The gauge manufacturer was contacted at time of reporting.  The RSO will notify the LDEQ of incident status changes.\"    Event report ID number: LA20250008",

The current activity would be approximately 17.5 Ci due to decay.    The RSO contacted the members of the University of Maine Facilities Maintenance department, as well as contractors working on site, and it was relayed that heavy construction had been occurring in the facility during the last two months, and that the sign may have been damaged during cleaning. It was surmised that the sign was likely disposed of in the trash, but this could not be directly confirmed by anyone. The RSO will continue to gather additional information that will be included in a written report to be submitted within 30 days.

The gauge contains a 40 millicurie Am-241 source and a 10 millicurie Cs-137 source. The radiation safety officer (RSO) stated the gauge was being used at a field site.     \"The technician needed to go to the bathroom and placed the gauge into its transport case. The technician locked the transport case, placed it into the back of the truck, and put a locking cable through one of the transport case handles. The technician left the area and, when he arrived at the convenience store, he found the tail gate down and the case and gauge missing. The cable that was through the handle was still secured to the truck and through the case handle, but the handle had been pulled off the case.

Upon opening the package, it was found to contain two nuclear gauges, both with their shutters in the locked open position.  One gauge was laying on its side and was most likely the cause of the 1R/hr reading.  The gauges were a Thermo Fisher gauge, model 5202, serial number B3308 (500 mCi Cs-137) and a Kay-Ray gauge, model 7063P, serial number S92L3001 (200 mCi Cs-137).

At 0255 CDT the 'A' train centrifugal charging pump was declared inoperable due to an unexpected loss of control room indication for the 'A' train centrifugal charging pump miniflow valve.    \"Therefore, both trains of the centrifugal charging (high head injection) system were simultaneously inoperable. This condition is being reported as an eight-hour, non-emergency notification per 10 CFR 50.72(b)(3)(v)(D). A fuse was replaced on the 'A' train centrifugal charging pump miniflow valve breaker, restoring operability of that system at 0500.    \"There was no impact on the health and safety of the public or plant personnel.    \"The NRC Resident Inspector has been notified.\"    * * * RETRACTION ON 9/17/2025 AT 1747 EDT FROM ZACHARY MILLIGAN TO KAREN COTTON * * *    The following information was provided by the licensee via phone and email:    \"Event Notification (EN) 57919, made on 09/11/25, pursuant to 10 CFR 50.72(b)(3)(v)(D), is being retracted based on further review of the timing of when the 'B' train essential service water (ESW) system was operable and capable of performing its support function for the 'B' train centrifugal charge pump (CCP).    \"Further review of restoration procedures/processes determined that the 'B' train ESW system was operable by 0232 CDT on 9/11/25, which was prior to the loss of the 'A' train CCP mini-flow valve (0255 on 09/11/25).

The theft was witnessed [by a member of the public] but by the time police (Humble Police Department) arrived, the perpetrator was gone. The licensee personnel were not notified, and they called the police again. A written report was received at 0948 hours. The [licensee's] radiation safety officer stated they think the handle lock was in place; accordingly, there is no immediate threat to the general public.    \"Additional information will be provided in accordance with SA - 300 reporting.\"    Texas incident number:  10227, NMED number TX250046    THIS MATERIAL EVENT CONTAINS A 'Less than Cat 3' LEVEL OF RADIOACTIVE MATERIAL    Sources that are \"Less than IAEA Category 3 sources,\" are either sources that are very unlikely to cause permanent injury to individuals or contain a very small amount of radioactive material that would not cause any permanent injury. Some of these sources, such as moisture density gauges or thickness gauges that are Category 4, the amount of unshielded radioactive material, if not safely managed or securely protected, could possibly - although it is unlikely - temporarily injure someone who handled it or were otherwise in contact with it, or who were close to it for a period of many weeks.

When the external packaging was opened, it was discovered that the internal shipping container had been damaged. It is believed that the damage to the internal shipping container degraded the effectiveness of the shielding, resulting in the external radiation levels measured. The Department will follow-up with additional information as it is developed.    * * * UPDATE ON 09/15/2025 AT 1319 EDT FROM JAMES PATE TO ROBERT THOMPSON * * *    The following is a summary of information provided by the licensee via email:    The package was supposed to be an excepted package. The package was damaged. The package received contained one source with the lid off the transport container inside the package. The activity of the source initially reported was the current activity; the original activity of the source was 10 mCi.

The trip was not complex, with all safety systems responding normally post-trip. Operations responded and stabilized the plant. Normal reactor level and pressure control systems are controlling as expected. Decay heat is being removed by discharging steam to the main condenser using turbine bypass valves.

The radiation safety officer (RSO) stated the radiographer hit another vehicle and then left the scene of the accident and went to their hotel. Someone provided the license plate number of the radiographer's truck to law enforcement. Law enforcement found the truck at the hotel, arrested the radiographer, and had the truck with the source transported to an impoundment yard. The truck was towed at 0300 CDT on September 12, 2025. The RSO was contacted by the impoundment yard, picked the truck up at 0830 that same morning, and returned the source to its storage location.    \"The RSO stated that the locks on the darkroom door and the transportation box were still intact.

CBP held the vehicle and determined that the company, RQ Construction Co., was not licensed to possess a gauge with this level of radioactivity. CBP notified the Department of the incident and contacted Troxler and arranged for transport of the gauge to Troxler's facility in North Carolina. The Department has learned that the model 3430 gauge was sent for calibration and leak testing at Troxler by a Florida-licensed company in Tampa, FL.      The Department has learned that RQ Construction Co. recently purchased a Troxler 4950 soil density gauge. This model of gauge does not require a radioactive materials license for possession and use. Troxler is investigating how the model 3430 gauge was returned to an unlicensed company in Jacksonville, FL.    THIS MATERIAL EVENT CONTAINS A 'Less than Cat 3' LEVEL OF RADIOACTIVE MATERIAL    Sources that are \"Less than IAEA Category 3 sources,\" are either sources that are very unlikely to cause permanent injury to individuals or contain a very small amount of radioactive material that would not cause any permanent injury. Some of these sources, such as moisture density gauges or thickness gauges that are Category 4, the amount of unshielded radioactive material, if not safely managed or securely protected, could possibly - although it is unlikely - temporarily injure someone who handled it or were otherwise in contact with it, or who were close to it for a period of many weeks.

According to email transcripts, the [common] carrier stated the packages were still on site but had not been released for unknown reasons. There were no concerns of exposures to persons in unrestricted areas. On Tuesday, 9/16/25, the packages were then released and shipped to the intended recipient.    \"It is unclear if the carrier declared the packages as lost and the reporting criteria in 10 CFR 20.2201 had been met.

This is the second shipment of brachytherapy seeds since August, 2025, in which contamination was identified. The first occurrence identified contamination within the shipping vial and no leaking seeds. That occurrence failed to meet reportable criteria. Both shipments had been received directly from the manufacturer, Theragenics, in Georgia. The contamination did not result in any public or occupational exposures, nor were the licensee's facilities contaminated. However, based on additional information provided on September 11, 2025, this matter is reportable to the Agency under 32 Ill. Adm. Code 340.1230(a)(3)(A), the State's equivalent of 10 CFR 20.2203(a)(3)(i). The seeds have been returned to the manufacturer for investigation and to determine if a seed was leaking or there is a repeat instance of a contaminated shipping vial.    \"Details: The shipment consisted of (72) sources at 1.55 millicuries each, for a total consignment of 267.3 millicuries. The brachytherapy seeds are TheraSeed model 200's, under registry number NR-0645-S-101-S. Upon receipt and transfer of brachytherapy seeds to a sterile area, the Illinois licensee surveys the empty shipping vial. It is in this step they identified contamination, later quantified to be approximately 0.013 microcuries. The reportability stems from the fact their license requires testing for contamination prior to incorporating the sources into an implanting device. The reporting threshold is 0.005 microcuries, and thus, this represented the presence of contamination in a restricted area breaching an applicable limit in the license. It is noteworthy a previous incident reported to the Agency on August 21, 2025, also found contamination in a shipping vial, although it did not exceed 0.005 microcuries. The Georgia program was contacted and notified of the incident as well. The licensee met applicable reporting timelines. This report will be updated with any additional information provided by the manufacturer.\"    Item Number: IL250039",

The reactor was being operated by a senior reactor operator (SRO) and a student authorized operator. A positive-period excess reactivity measurement was being performed. The reactor power rose to 5.64 watts. The technical specifications power limit of 6 watts plus was not exceeded, and both safety channels functioned to shut the reactor down.      This prompt notification for a high-power trip is in accordance with current procedures and technical specification 6.9.2.a.7. The proximate cause of this event was operator distraction. The reactor room had two visitors at the time of the event, an NRC inspector and a University of New Mexico nuclear engineering instructor. The instructor was engaging the student authorized operator and the SRO on matters relating to a laboratory activity ongoing in another part of the building. The SRO responded to the rising power too slowly to avoid the high-power trip.",

STP-1 entered Technical Specification (TS) 3.5.2 Action A for Train B ECCS, requiring restoration within 7 days or apply the requirements of the (Configuration Risk Management Program) CRMP.    \"On 09/25/2025 at 1229, Train A essential chiller 12A was declared inoperable due to inability to maintain chiller water outlet temperature less than 52 Fahrenheit. This cascaded down to the Train A ECCS Subsystem to render it inoperable. STP-1 entered TS 3.5.2 Action B due to less than two of the required subsystems operable, within 1 hour restore at least two subsystems to operable status or apply the requirements of the CRMP, or be in at least Hot Standby within the next 6 hours and in Hot Shutdown within the following 6 hours.     \"On 09/25/2025 at 1329, STP-1 entered CRMP based on two ECCS subsystems remaining inoperable longer than 1 hour. These subsystems are used for accident mitigation. Unit 1 remains in mode 1.\"",
