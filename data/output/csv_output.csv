The limit switches were dedicated by CW and shipped on 2/28/2025 to Xcel Energy. The switches failed a bench test performed by Xcel Energy, which aimed to verify that the contacts properly revert to their original state during spring return. Xcel Energy found that the contacts reverted to their original state prior to the audible click/snap, which is supposed to indicate contact changeover.    The two units were returned to Curtiss-Wright on 5/29/2025. The test result was fully duplicated on one of the switches. For the other switch (serial number 04), the switch contacts intermittently failed to return to the original state at all, requiring manual assistance to do so.    On 6/26/2025, CW sent the parts to NAMCO for repair. CW retested the parts after the repair. Part 04 still had the same issue with failing to reset as noted earlier. That limit switch was returned to NAMCO for a full evaluation.     CW anticipates an update to this notification with final results on 9/23/2025.

This event occurred on SR 16 eastbound directly before the Tacoma Narrows Bridge in Gig Harbor, Washington. The nuclear gauge that was damaged was a licensed Troxler model 3450. The damage appeared to consist of the handle being separated from the body of the gauge. The gauge was not in use at the time.    """"The radiation safety officer (RSO) cordoned off the area and prevented individuals from coming within 150 feet of the source. The timeline of this event is still being investigated. The RSO contacted WADOH at 0205 PDT. Emergency response, consisting of fire and hazmat personnel, arrived on site at approximately 0500 equipped with a Geiger Mueller radiation detection instrument. Two individuals donned Tyvek [suits] and proceeded towards the source, with WADOH directing their response via telephone communication. The highest radiation levels were 15 mR/hr, measured approximately one foot from the source, which indicated that the sources were likely still within the shielded position. The two emergency responders used a shovel to pick the source handle and gauge body up and place the pieces back into the Troxler type 'A' shipping container. This took approximately 8 minutes and the dose received is assumed to be less than 2 mrem each. The container was then closed, and additional radiation surveys were taken. The on contact dose on the exterior of the container was 2 mR/hr, which is below the expected dose rate while within the container. WADOH arrived on-site at approximately 0730 PDT and took contamination surveys on the source assembly, which was visibly intact. No contamination was detected.     """"Under Troxler's guidance, the licensee transported the material within the type 'A' container back to their calibration facility to perform leak tests. Leak tests have been performed and are being sent out for counting prior to shipment back to Troxler. The gauge will remain in a secured position until it is shipped back to Troxler. The licensee will follow Troxler guidance and all applicable DOT regulations. A full report will be delivered to WADOH within 30 days.
